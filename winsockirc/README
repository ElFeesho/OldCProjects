Hey chief- I compiled this with mingw on linux- so... it should work, but I can't
be 100%. I STRONGLY advise you use Dev-C++, it's just so easier to get to grips with
and also it's actually standard ansi C/C++ it uses, instead of microsofts' twisted
idea of C/C++ (stdafx.h is not standard at all!).

The bot is pretty simple, it responds to "COOKIES" and "QUIT" but it's very basic,
if you wanna mess about with getting the nickname of who said what, I recommend
reading the std::string api references some where off the net.

If you need any help at all hop into ##nonlogic on freenode

It's 2:15am and I want to sleep! hehe

Gnight; Feesh
