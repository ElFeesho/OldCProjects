Nonlogicpad is a collaborative drawing program, which allows multiple users
under partitions of a channel system similar to IRC, to collectively and 
collaboratively draw graphics or diagrams.

Possible usages could include, design work, general explanations of complex
visual scenarios where text falls short, or to just play noughts and crosses,
or tic tac toe.

In order for NLPad to compile, you need:

GTK+-2.0 (And all it's requirements)
Gnet-2.0 (www.gnetlibrary.org)
Libxml2

Once you have all these development libraries, NLPad should compile.

In order for NLPad to be useful, it will need to connect to a server.

nlpad.nonlogic.org is usually up, but if it is not, compile the server
for yourself and connect to it.

Special Thanks to Muntyan for help on the configure script
